Wayne and Shaphen want to give you more opportunities to practice.
So here you go!

# Note: this practice is in a repository. Do not nest this into your git repo

# They highly recommend you start with:
 - bundle install
 - rails db:setup <!-- note: this may take a few minutes to install -->
 - bundle exec rspec

# a/A generally recommends you approach these problems in the order of:
 - completing belongs_to first
 - working on has_many next
 - finishing with throughs

Don't forget to utilize your schema in 'db/schema.rb'

 invoices table stores invoice header data and the invoice_items table stores 
 the invoice line items data.
